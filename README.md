# scaffold-eth-nextjs

This is a work in progress!

My iteration of [Austin Griffith's scaffold-eth](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth).
Also inspired by [Nader Dabit's blog post](https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-ethereum-development-3j13)

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
- [web3-react](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- Formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Linting, typechecking and formatting on by default using [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for commit hooks
- Testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [`react-testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

## Getting Started

This project uses Yarn Workspaces, so you'll need [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChangoMan/scaffold-eth-nextjs.git
cd scaffold-eth-nextjs

yarn install

# Start up the Hardhat Network
yarn chain
```

Here we just install the npm project's dependencies, and by running `yarn chain` we spin up an instance of Hardhat Network that you can connect to using MetaMask. In a different terminal in the same directory, run:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This will deploy the contract to Hardhat Network. After this completes run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start up the Next.js development server and your site will be available at http://localhost:3000/

To interact with the local contract, be sure to switch your MetaMask Network to `Localhost 8545`
